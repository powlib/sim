# Summary

This repo contains the python simulation source of the powlib library. Please note the powlib.drivers and powlib.monitors packages are deprecated. Instead, please rely on the other modules and packages for verification, in particular the powlib.verify package. At some point, once the tests have all been re-written to support the powlib.verify package, powlib.drivers and powlib.monitors will be removed. 

Running make under tcf should execute all the tests.
